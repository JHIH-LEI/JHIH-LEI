### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My major is Business Administration. Graduate from a well-know bootcamp [Alpha Camp](https://tw.alphacamp.co/) in 10/2021

I have a passion for learning, sharing knowledge, and helping others grow into their best selves.

As a student, I took many business-related courses outside of my formal education. 

I also served as the Vice President of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Club at my university,
and held the position of Academic Director for the Design Thinking club at NTU. 

These experiences stem from my passion for helping others succeed.
