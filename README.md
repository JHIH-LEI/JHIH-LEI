### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My major is Business Administration. Graduate from a well-know bootcamp [Alpha Camp](https://tw.alphacamp.co/) in 10/2020

I love to learn, share and want to become a entrepreneur in the future.

So when I was a student I took a lot business related programs/courses outside of school.

Also leaded a Innovation and Entrepreneurship Club in my university as vice president.
